Since the given code is specific to JavaScript and web-vitals, a direct conversion to Python is not possible. However, if you want to measure web performance in Python, you can use the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and measure the response time. Here's a simple example:

```python
import requests
import time

def measure_response_time(url):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = requests.get(url)
    end_time = time.time()
    response_time = end_time - start_time
    return response_time

url = "https://example.com"
response_time = measure_response_time(url)
print(f"Response time for {url}: {response_time} seconds")
```

This code measures the response time for a given URL using the `requests` library. Note that this is not a direct conversion of the JavaScript code, but an alternative approach to measuring web performance in Python.
